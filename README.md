# MacOSHardening

Welcome to MacOSHardening â€“ your go-to repository for enhancing the security of macOS 14.0 Sonoma clients managed through Microsoft Intune.

## About This Repository
This repository contains JSON and custom .mobileconfig files designed to improve macOS 14.0 Sonoma security via Intune, based on the settings catalog and the baselines provided by [NIST](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security.). They follow the industry-recognized CIS Benchmarks for macOS hardening.

## What's Inside
* JSON Hardening Files: Each file is an export from a settings catalog configuration, offering you a plug-and-play solution for immediately enhancing your system's security posture.
* Wide Compatibility: Primarily designed for macOS 14.0 Sonoma , these hardening files should be compatible and effective on older versions of macOS.

### How to Use
* Download: Select and download the JSON files applicable to your system version (Windows 10 or Windows 11).
* Import to Intune: Easily import these files into your Microsoft Intune environment.
* Apply Settings: Deploy these settings across your Windows clients to enforce a robust security framework.

### Why CIS Benchmarks?
CIS Benchmarks are globally recognized as a gold standard for securing IT systems and data against cyber threats. By aligning the hardening files with these benchmarks, as much as possible, this provides you with a trustworthy and effective way to harden your macOS environments against vulnerabilities. The free available PDF files and NIST repo have been a source for building the Intune configuration files.
